AVALANCHE OF TERRIBLE NOTES FOR MY DEVICT TALK - AUTOMATING GIMP WITH PYTHON
============================================================================

## Scratchpad

2 approaches to using Python to automate GIMP
* Script-Fu - Scheme-based extension language implemented using TinyScheme
* GIMP-Python - set of Python modules acting as a wrapper to libgimp for authoring GIMP plug-ins.  Similar to Script-Fu, but you can use the full set of Python extension modules from the plug-in

Other approaches to automating GIMP
* You could also script with Perl or Tcl - but I have no idea about that stuff.  Not as much info after GIMP-Python gained in popularity.
  * I like learning Perl *every time* I need to use it.  But I don't *need* to use it here.  So I won't!
  * I don't know what Tcl is, and I'm not emotionally prepared to Google it yet.

* There are more GUI - centric solutions.  Strictly batch-like, good for if you don't 
  * There exists David's Batch Processor ... or it looks like that's dead... oh, it's alive!  It's been a rollercoaster of emotion for me!
