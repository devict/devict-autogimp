AVALANCHE OF TERRIBLE NOTES FOR MY DEVICT TALK - AUTOMATING GIMP WITH PYTHON
============================================================================

## Scratchpad

2 approaches to using Python to automate GIMP
* Script-Fu - Scheme-based extension language implemented using TinyScheme
* GIMP-Python - set of Python modules acting as a wrapper to libgimp for authoring GIMP plug-ins.  Similar to Script-Fu, but you can use the full set of Python extension modules from the plug-in
